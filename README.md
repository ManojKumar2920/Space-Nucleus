# Space Nucleus

**Space Nucleus** is a 3D animation project built with React Three Fiber, Drei, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases an immersive space-themed animation experience, demonstrating the power and flexibility of modern web technologies in creating interactive 3D graphics.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Animation**: Utilize React Three Fiber and Drei to create a dynamic and engaging space-themed animation.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Fast and Scalable**: Developed with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.

## Installation

To get started with the Space Nucleus project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-nucleus.git
   cd space-nucleus
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   
    ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit:

   ```bash
   (http://localhost:3000)
   ```

## Usage

- **React Three Fiber**: This library allows you to use Three.js in a declarative way within React applications. It's used to create and manipulate 3D scenes with React components.

- **Drei**: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber, making it easier to work with common Three.js elements and effects.

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing a robust structure for building and optimizing web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application. It allows for quick and flexible UI design with a predefined set of classes.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the application's pages and routing configuration. Each file in this directory represents a route in the application.

- `components/`: Includes React components used throughout the application. This is where you'll find components related to the 3D animation as well as any UI elements.

- `public/`: Stores static assets such as images, fonts, and other files that need to be publicly accessible. Files in this directory can be served directly by the Next.js server.
